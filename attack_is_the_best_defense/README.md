Attack is the best defense

In this project, we will not go over ARP spoofing, but weâ€™ll start by sniffing unencrypted traffic and getting information out of it.

 Your mission is to execute user_authenticating_into_server locally on your machine and, using tcpdump, sniff the network to find my password. Once you find it, paste the password in your answer file. This script will not work on a Docker container or Mac OS, use your Ubuntu vagrant machine or any other Linux machine.
