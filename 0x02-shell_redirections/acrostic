Elizabeth it is in vain you say
Love not"â€”thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
Breath it less gently forthâ€”and veil thine eyes.
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried
To cure his loveâ€”was cured of all besideâ€”
His follieâ€”prideâ€”and passionâ€”for he died.
