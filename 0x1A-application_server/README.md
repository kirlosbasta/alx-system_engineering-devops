## Tasks
### 0. Set up development with Python

Letâ€™s serve what you built for AirBnB clone v2 - Web framework on web-01. This task is an exercise in setting up your development environment, which is used for testing and debugging your code before deploying it to production.

Requirements:

Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01. The checker will connect to your servers.
Install the net-tools package on your server: sudo apt install -y net-tools
Git clone your AirBnB_clone_v2 on your web-01 server.
Configure the file web_flask/0-hello_route.py to serve its content from the route /airbnb-onepage/ on port 5000.
Your Flask application object must be named app (This will allow us to run and check your code).
Example:

Window 1:

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~/AirBnB_clone_v2$ python3 -m web_flask.0-hello_route
 * Serving Flask app "0-hello_route" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
